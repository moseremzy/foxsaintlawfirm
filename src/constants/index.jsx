Onofowokan J. in dismissing the suit held that,“The author of Halsburys Law of England, 4th Edition, Volume 27, paragraph 260 at 200 said that at common law, a tenant has no right to demand information about the calculation or appointment of a service charge, a tenant can only persuade the landlord to disclose the relevant information. To that extent, since the sub-lease exhibits A & I does not contain express provision that the Plaintiffs should be consulted  in the determination and disbursement of service charge to be paid by the lessees, to imply and or read such into the contract would contradict the express terms investing the defendant/sub-lease with the obligation to determine and apportion the cost of providing and running the services in the Estate, and to do so would tantamount to re-writing the contract for the parties, which is not in the office of the court to do. Consultation with the sub-leases would therefore, in my view not be necessary to give efficacy to the intention of the parties as expressed in Exhibit A & I”.
