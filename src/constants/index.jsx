Onofowokan J. in dismissing the suit held that,“The author of Halsburys Law of England, 4th Edition, Volume 27, paragraph 260 at 200 said that at common law, a tenant has no right to demand information about the calculation or appointment of a service charge, a tenant can only persuade the landlord to disclose the relevant information. To that extent, since the sub-lease exhibits A & I does not contain express provision that the Plaintiffs should be consulted  in the determination and disbursement of service charge to be paid by the lessees, to imply and or read such into the contract would contradict the express terms investing the defendant/sub-lease with the obligation to determine and apportion the cost of providing and running the services in the Estate, and to do so would tantamount to re-writing the contract for the parties, which is not in the office of the court to do. Consultation with the sub-leases would therefore, in my view not be necessary to give efficacy to the intention of the parties as expressed in Exhibit A & I”.

INTRODUCTION

The constitutional protection of women’s inheritance and property rights in the United States is anchored in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits the state from enforcing any law or practice that institutionalizes gender-based disadvantage. Inheritance is no longer treated as a private familial privilege but as a dimension of legal personhood and economic citizenship. Modern U.S. jurisprudence characterizes exclusion from succession rights as a form of state-endorsed hierarchy, thereby bringing it within constitutional review. The American model thus elevates women’s succession rights to the status of a structural constitutional guarantee rather than a discretionary legislative policy.

While this approach is uniquely constitutionalized in the United States, other major economies have travelled parallel reform pathways through different legal architectures. China anchors inheritance equality through civil law codification under its Civil Code, creating a statutory basis that guarantees women legal standing in succession and property relations irrespective of marital or familial status. Australia, by contrast, operates a hybrid model that combines statutory protections with robust judicial interpretation, particularly under family law and succession reform acts that explicitly prohibit gender-based exclusion.

These three jurisdictions collectively represent the prevailing direction of contemporary global legal development: namely, that women’s access to property is indispensable to economic autonomy, social participation, and equality before the law. The convergence of doctrine across systems — whether rooted in constitutionalism (United States), codification (China), or hybrid statutory adjudication (Australia) — reflects an international legal consensus that inheritance equality is integral to modern citizenship.

CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK IN THE UNITED STATES

Under the Fourteenth Amendment, gender-based exclusion from inheritance operates as a suspect form of classification because it regulates economic participation and family rights through state-recognized mechanisms. The jurisprudential shift in the U.S. treats succession rights not merely as private entitlements but as a site where the state either affirms or denies equal citizenship. The constitutional threshold is therefore not one of fairness alone but of state legitimacy: the government may not sustain institutions that replicate patriarchal dependency or legal subordination.

COMPARATIVE INSIGHT: CHINA

China’s approach embeds gender equality through codified inheritance law rather than constitutional adjudication. The Civil Code guarantees equal rights for daughters, spouses, and female dependents in all intestate and testate succession matters. The emphasis is on uniform statutory protection rather than constitutional litigation, producing a system where equality is stabilized through comprehensive codification.

COMPARATIVE INSIGHT: AUSTRALIA

Australia adopts a hybrid statutory–judicial framework that prohibits gender discrimination in succession regimes and empowers courts to rectify unequal treatment through equitable redistribution. This model ensures that women’s property rights are preserved not only against overt exclusion, but also against subtler forms of structural economic disadvantage.

GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE

Together, these frameworks illustrate a convergence in global legal thought: the law now conceives inheritance as an instrument of equality, not lineage privilege. Autonomous property ownership is treated as an essential component of substantive equality and economic agency, and modern constitutional and statutory systems increasingly regard gender exclusion as incompatible with the legal order.

CONCLUSION

Women’s succession rights are firmly established in contemporary constitutional and statutory structures across leading jurisdictions. In the United States, this protection derives from constitutional equality; in China, from codified civil guarantees; and in Australia, from a hybridized statutory-judicial model. Despite doctrinal differences, all three systems affirm the same core principle: property is not a gendered entitlement but an incident of equal citizenship.`

INTRODUCTION:

The Securities Modernisation Act, 2025 (“SMA 2025” or “the Act”) represents a significant advance in aligning capital market regulation with the evolving realities of global finance, complex cross-border investment flows, and rapidly developing technological infrastructures. It reflects a deeper shift in market governance toward enhanced transparency, systemic risk containment, and investor protection—principles consistent with reforms adopted in the United States, China, and Australia following IOSCO standards.

SMA 2025 consolidates and elevates key market oversight functions by expressly recognising digital and tokenised financial instruments as regulated securities, modernising exchange supervision, and creating a comprehensive architecture for financial market infrastructures (FMIs). It also introduces a stricter legal regime for market abuse, strengthens supervisory enforcement, and embeds international comparability into core regulatory design—particularly in the treatment of digital assets, exchange obligations, systemic intervention powers, and corporate control events.

This article highlights the major provisions of the SMA 2025 and summarises what market participants should understand from a compliance, governance, and regulatory risk perspective.

NOTABLE PROVISIONS IN THE SMA 2025:

Recognition of Digital and Tokenised Assets as Regulated Securities:
The Act confirms that tokenised financial instruments, cryptocurrencies used as investment vehicles, and blockchain-based securities products fall within regulatory perimeter oversight. This mirrors the approach of the U.S. SEC, China’s CSRC, and ASIC’s market infrastructure framework.

Reclassification of Securities Exchanges:
SMA 2025 formally distinguishes between full-service (composite) securities exchanges and non-composite or specialised platforms. This permits proportional regulation while maintaining elevated governance requirements for market operators.

Oversight of Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs):
The Act establishes a distinct regulatory category for FMIs, including clearinghouses, settlement utilities, and trading repositories, subjecting them to resilience, capital, and continuity standards consistent with CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.

Market Conduct and Enforcement Against Unauthorised Schemes:
The Act includes explicit prohibitions on unregistered investment vehicles, high-risk unregulated platforms, and fraudulent solicitation schemes. It grants the supervisory authority direct enforcement powers consistent with cross-border best practice.

Systemic Risk Intervention Powers:
Regulators are empowered to deploy pre-emptive or extraordinary market-stability measures—including temporary trading halts—where macroprudential risk, contagion effects, or market infrastructure stress threaten orderly functioning.

Corporate Control and Transactional Oversight:
Major market transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, and takeovers involving publicly listed entities require prior regulatory clearance to safeguard market integrity and investor fairness.

Commodities Market Regulation:
The Act creates a unified regulatory structure for commodities exchanges and provides recognition for warehouse receipts as proprietary financial instruments, in alignment with international commodity market governance frameworks.

Unclaimed Investor Funds:
Investor funds or distributions left dormant are now subject to regulated custody, transparency, and audit-trail protections under supervisory oversight.

Strengthened Dispute Resolution:
Tribunal jurisdiction in capital market disputes is reinforced through expanded adjudicatory capacity and procedural harmonisation with international best practice.

Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) Requirements:
All eligible counterparties in securities transactions must maintain LEIs to promote transparency, risk tracking, and regulatory cross-referencing across financial systems.

CONCLUSION:

The SMA 2025 is a foundational recalibration of capital market supervision and brings domestic regulatory posture closer to the standards underpinning U.S., Chinese, and Australian market reforms. By strengthening oversight over digital securities, market conduct, systemic stability, and corporate control transparency, the Act enhances investor confidence and deepens institutional credibility in line with global norms.

Traditionally, this protection extends to literary, musical, artistic, audiovisual, and digital works created by humans. In the United States, originality, human creativity, and fixation remain core foundational elements of copyrightability.[1] Similar frameworks apply across most advanced jurisdictions, including the EU, China, and Australia, where human authorship remains the baseline threshold for protection.[2]`,

The U.S. Copyright Office maintains that purely machine-generated works, lacking meaningful human creative input, are ineligible for copyright protection.[3] The European Union’s “intellectual creation” test also presumes human autonomy in the creative act.[4]  
            
China adopts a more expansive approach by permitting legal persons (including corporate entities) to hold authorship rights where organizational creative contribution is established.[5] Some scholars argue this opens a potential pathway for certain AI-assisted works to be treated as attributable to the deploying entity, even if indirectly linked to machine systems.[6]

Australia, like the U.S., firmly rejects non-human authorship and emphasizes individual creative participation.[7] Global divergence is growing, however, as jurisdictions grapple with increasingly autonomous forms of machine-driven content creation. The core unresolved question remains: when the AI is an active generative force, who—if anyone—is the "author" for legal purposes?`,

          `Other jurisdictions are approaching this issue differently: China permits broader institutional authorship recognition, while the EU continues to refine its originality thresholds in light of AI-dependence in creative industries. Australia aligns closely with the U.S. approach, requiring human originality as a precondition for enforceable copyright rights.`,

      {
        header: "The Legal Grey Area: Copyright Ownership of AI-Generated Works",
        text: `AI has exposed fundamental gaps in copyright doctrine. U.S. federal courts have repeatedly emphasized the human–authorship standard. In Thaler v. Perlmutter, a federal district court affirmed that AI alone cannot be deemed an “author” under existing U.S. copyright law.[10] Similarly, the well-known Naruto v. Slater case reinforced that copyright protection presumes human agency.[11]

By contrast, China’s evolving jurisprudence suggests a willingness to treat AI-assisted works as protectable where human discretion, oversight, and substantial intervention can be demonstrated.[12] The EU’s approach remains tied to the “intellectual creation” doctrine, which, like the U.S., centers on human autonomy—but with slightly broader interpretive space for hybrid authorship frameworks.[13]

The legal uncertainty is further amplified by unresolved questions surrounding training data provenance, moral rights, personality rights, and chain-of-title fragmentation. As AI becomes more autonomous—particularly in generative multimedia—policymakers must determine whether copyright will remain a purely anthropocentric system or evolve toward hybrid or shared authorship constructs.`,

Current debates before the U.S. Copyright Office contemplate pathways for human-AI joint authorship, tiered protection for derivative algorithmic outputs, and registration protocols requiring disclosure of AI contributions.[14]

Proposed models include:
• Establishing a statutory threshold for “substantial human contribution”;  
• Recognizing hybrid or co-authorship between human creators and institutional entities deploying AI;  
• Encouraging transparency of training datasets to reduce ownership disputes;  
• Adoption of blockchain-enabled provenance registries for AI-assisted works;  
• Regulatory sandboxes for creative-technology innovation under USPTO/USCO oversight.

The United States is expected to shape the global standard, with China and the EU acting as principal comparators, and Australia maintaining parallel alignment with U.S. authorship doctrine.`,

While U.S. law continues to anchor authorship in human creativity, emerging comparative developments in China and the EU illustrate shifting doctrinal boundaries. Policymakers must now determine whether traditional frameworks remain sufficient, or whether a hybrid model recognizing human–AI collaboration is inevitable. The legal system’s next challenge will be designing a copyright architecture that preserves innovation incentives while sustaining accountability and authorship legitimacy in an increasingly algorithmic creative economy.`,
